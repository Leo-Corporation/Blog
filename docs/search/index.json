[{"content":"Almost two years after its first stable release, we\u0026rsquo;re proud to introduce you Gavilya 3, the next evolution of our game launcher.\nA new design With this new iteration of Gavilya, we decided to improve the user experience alongside with the user interface. Gavilya 3 now features a sidebar where you can find the home page, your games, those you played recently, and also your favorites. You can access you notifications directly from sidebar too. Located on the left side of the app, the sidebar gathers all of Gavilya\u0026rsquo;s features in one place. With the new sidebar, all buttons and menus in the title bar have been removed.\nImproved profiles Profiles are an important feature of Gavilya. In version 3, the profile experience has been improved; we merged your profile page with the profile switcher, making it easier than ever to create and manage profiles in Gavilya.\nModern settings The settings window of Gavilya wasn\u0026rsquo;t really intuitive; therefore, we completely re-imagined the settings experience. Settings can now be access straight from the sidebar, and it will shows up in a new page instead of a window. You can now focus more on what you want to do with the new settings page design: It\u0026rsquo;s simple and intuitive. The design is similar to the one used in our other apps.\nNew card view We\u0026rsquo;ve also redesigned a key part of Gavilya: The card view. You will notice that the play button is no longer visible by default: To bring it back, simply hover the card and it will show up again. When hovering a card, you can also now see the name of the game at a glance.\nSorting options We\u0026rsquo;ve also added sorting options to Gavilya: You can sort your games by the alphabetical order or not.\nOther improvements We\u0026rsquo;ve also improved the design consistency across all the pages of Gavilya. We made improvements to performances and fixed some issues. You can now disable notifications as well.\nYou can find the full changelog of this release here.\nDownload Click here to download Gavilya.\n","date":"2022-10-28T11:17:28+02:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/10/introducing-gavilya-3/cover_hu765f5177530cea61d1117bc20db0cb56_1388935_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/10/introducing-gavilya-3/","title":"Introducing Gavilya 3"},{"content":"A new version of ColorPicker is now available, and it is the version 4.5.0.2210.\nChangelog New Added XYZ color type (#170) Added the possibility to copy XYZ color (#170) Added the possibility to convert a XYZ color (#170) Added YIQ color type (#171) Added the possibility to copy YIQ color (#171) Added the possibility to convert a YIQ color (#171) Added new colors to tooltip Added translations (#172) Added the possibility to generate a palette from any color type (#172) Added the possibility to calculate the contrast ratio in text tool (#173) Fixed Fixed a translation issue Made the app smoother when closing it (#174) Download Click here to download ColorPicker\nScreenshot ","date":"2022-10-21T13:33:15+02:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/10/colorpicker-version-4.5.0.2210-is-now-available/cover_huce9a9bf74522a0a54d5f12a28907a43a_33850_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/10/colorpicker-version-4.5.0.2210-is-now-available/","title":"ColorPicker: Version 4.5.0.2210 is now available"},{"content":"A new version of InternetTest Pro is now available and brings several new features, while fixing some other issues.\nChangelog New Added the possibility to remember the window state (#367) Added \u0026ldquo;Confidential Mode\u0026rdquo; button (#368) Added translations (#368) Added Confidential Mode in \u0026ldquo;My IP\u0026rdquo; page (#368) Added Confidential Mode in \u0026ldquo;Locate IP\u0026rdquo; page (#368) Added Confidential Mode in \u0026ldquo;IP Config\u0026rdquo; page (#368) Added Confidential Mode in \u0026ldquo;WiFi Passwords\u0026rdquo; page (#368) Added new resource strings (#369) Added description text for authentication in WiFi Passwords (#369) Fixed Fixed \u0026ldquo;Unknown host\u0026rdquo; error (#366) \u0026ldquo;My IP\u0026rdquo; details are now hidden when Confidential Mode is enabled (#368) Fixed missing font issues Confidential Mode The Confidential Mode is a new feature of InternetTest which aims to protect the privacy and sensitive information of our users.

We are experience creators, and we are more than happy to share with you the pioneer of a new era, InternetTest Pro.\nA new and improved user interface InternetTest Pro, also called InternetTest 7, offers a new user interface; you will notice a brand-new side bar with “pinned” actions and different menus. You can access your favorite functionalities using this new side bar, or by using the “Home” dashboard; it is a place specially made for you where you can quickly find useful actions and features. We have added subtle animations as well.\nWe are also introducing an improved light and dark theme; the background of the window is no longer white: Instead, there is a subtle mesh gradient with different colors. The accent color is also more used in different part of the app. Finally, you will notice that there are less shades of gray, and more shades of blue used everywhere in InternetTest.\nAn experience conceived for you We want our users to have the best experience possible when they use our apps. We believe that our products should adapt to their needs, and that our users should not have to adapt to the limitations of our applications. Therefore, we want to introduce you Synethia, an algorithm that can understand your habits and which features you’d like to use. When you are using InternetTest Pro, Synethia will collect data on how you spent time with each feature, and which interactions you have made. The data is then analyzed, and this how the “Home” dashboard shows you recommended actions and features. The more you use InternetTest Pro, the more Synethia will be able to understand your needs.\nNow, we are aware that this feature will raise privacy concerns about the data collected, and we want to be fully transparent with you. The data is stored on your device anonymously and is NOT send to Léo Corporation. It is NOT used by any third-party application or company other than InternetTest itself. You have full control over your data; you can reset it or erase it completely. You can, at any time, disable Synethia in the Settings. Synethia cannot interact with other apps or program.\nA new set of features InternetTest Pro has all the features included in InternetTest 6, which are: Connection Status, Down Detector, My IP, and Locate an IP. With this new version we are introducing three new features: Ping, IP Config, and WiFi Passwords (recovery).\nPing The Ping feature allows you to send a ping request to specified IP address or URL. It works exactly like the “ping” command in Windows. You can get useful information when you make a ping, such as the maximum/minimum and average duration of each request, the number of packages sent, received, or lost, and the IP address if you provided an URL.\nIP Config The IP Config feature works the same as the “ipconfig” command available in the Windows command prompt. You will be able to get a list of all the network interfaces registered on your system. By default, only the connected interfaces details are expanded. You can copy the information of each interface. This information contains: Status (connected/disconnected), the DNS Suffix, the local IPv4 and IPv6 address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway IP address (in IPv4 and IPv6).\nWiFi Passwords This feature allows you to recover all passwords of all the WiFi networks you have already been connected to. By default, the page is empty for security reasons, you will need to click on the “Get locally stored networks” button to see all registered networks on your device. You can then expand each network details to learn more about the encryption algorithm, the authentication mode, the connection type/mode, and most importantly, the network key. The key is hidden by default; click on the “eye” icon next to it to show the key.\nA new history We are also glad to announce a unified history page. On this page you will be able to see the results of each test made using the “Status” or “Down Detector” feature. You can erase the history at any time.\nSimplified settings We are also committed to improvements of the settings page: Some sections are gone because we grouped them in a single category. For example, the default test website and the default HTTP protocol are now in the same “Web” category. The update system has also been reworked, so you can quickly see if InternetTest Pro is up to date or not. The theme and the default page picker have all been simplified.\nWhat is next for InternetTest 6? The support for InternetTest 6 will end; it won’t receive new features anymore. InternetTest Pro will not be offered as an upgrade of InternetTest 6 because we consider it as a different product. We will let our users choose whether they want to upgrade or not.\nDownload Click here to explore your new experience with InternetTest Pro.\nVideo Check the official trailer for InternetTest Pro.\n","date":"2022-08-26T11:19:43+02:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/08/introducing-internettest-pro/cover_hu7b31d3fb5bf90cfe747d085347192ded_871883_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/08/introducing-internettest-pro/","title":"Introducing InternetTest Pro"},{"content":"Today, we are releasing a huge update to our blog: We are switching from Blogger to Hugo, a static website generator. This change will give us more control over our content and makes it easier to publish new and exciting articles.\nWhat is new? The blog is now using a modern responsive theme that support both light and dark mode. We are introducing “Categories”; it is a new way to sort articles. There is now a table of content in every article, you can also see the estimated reading time next to the date. We have added links to our socials as well, and a brand new About page too.\nWhat is gone? With this new update, we have decided it is the best time to move on, so our older articles from 2018 to 2020, are no longer available, but they still are on the old blog which will stay accessible.\nWhat is next? We hope that you will like the modern design; we are excited to post new and better articles on this blog, as a big announcement is coming soon.\n","date":"2022-08-24T09:33:41+02:00","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/08/our-new-blog/","title":"Our New Blog"},{"content":"A new version of Datalya is now available, and it is the version 1.6.0.2208.\nChangelog New Added \u0026ldquo;Re-order\u0026rdquo;

The new one is – indeed – like Montserrat, but it adds some small details that makes it better than the old one.\nWhen will this change take effect?

They were specialized database management tools. They provided a brand new and modern user interface at the time. The goal was to rewrite the codebase from Visual Basic to C#, to introduce new features and a new design language. However, these two softwares were only available in French, not in English, and they weren’t receiving updates as much as other Léo Corporation’s softwares. This is why we are today introducing the next generation of database management at Léo Corporation: Datalya.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Datalya? Datalya is a modern and yet simple database management software for Windows. The main innovation of Datalya is Blocks. Blocks are different types of input for a user. For instance, you can have a simple text input, to a checkbox input, without forgetting the dropdown input. These Blocks are customizable, you can name theme, add choices, and more. You can even export your Blocks as a Template, so you can reuse them quickly in other databases. In a nutshell, Blocks are used to create your Database.\nYou can find Blocks in the “Creator” part. Talking about parts, Datalya is divided into two parts: The Creator part, and the Database part. We’ve talked about the Creator part already, so let’s move on to the Database part.\nThe Database part is where the database is. You’ll notice a ribbon UI at the top, and the database’s content filling the rest of the window. By default, it’s empty: Indeed, we need to add an item to the database first. You can go to “Edit” tab in the ribbon, and then click on “Add”. You’ll see that a window with your Blocks has appeared, and in this window, you can fill the fields and then add the item.\nOnce you’ve added the item, you can edit it, delete it, etc.\nThe other new feature is the possibility to export a database to an Excel spreadsheet. You can go to the “Export” tab of the ribbon and click on “Export to Excel”. Note that Datalya only supports .xlsx files.\nWhen launching Datalya, you’ll see the home screen, this is where all your recent files are shown for you to jump into a database quickly. You can even pin your most important databases if you have a lot of them.\nDatalya is also customizable: it is available in English and French, and it has a dark mode! You can also change update settings and reset them anytime.\nThere is still a lot of features that we didn’t covered in this article, but we will let you discover them by yourself. We’ve been working on Datalya for a few months now, and we focused on the design and on the user experience with the product, to deliver you an enjoyable experience while working on a database.\nAs always, Datalya will be free and Open-Source.\nWhat’s next for GestionBiblio X and GestionPerso X The release of Datalya also means that our old GestionBiblio X and GestionPerso X softwares are now deprecated, and we recommend that the users of theses products switch to Datalya. If you are a user of one of these products, you can create a new database in Datalya by selecting ether the “Books” template or the “People” template.\nWebsite Click here to go the website of Datalya.\nDownload Click here to download Datalya.\n","date":"2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/introducing-datalya/cover_hu585b845bac6b9b98f4e385dce7b37f4b_23177_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/introducing-datalya/","title":"Introducing Datalya"},{"content":"Educ’Maths was a game to test your knowledge in math. It was developed back in 2018, and was released under the name “Educ’Maths”, and later renamed “Educ’Maths 2018”. At the time, Educ’Maths was one of our first and biggest software we’ve ever released. Then, Educ’Maths became a series of games: Educ’Maths 2019, 2020, and finally, 2021. For each edition, we tried to push the limit of the previous one, and we went from a simple quiz game to an interactive and fun game in 2021. In June 2021, 23% of downloaded softwares were Educ’Maths games.\nHowever, we have decided to end the Educ’Maths series here.\nIn previous blog articles, we told you that 2021 is going to be a big year for Léo Corporation, and indeed, we’ve release in 2021 more softwares and software updates than ever. Our vision has through the years evolved, and today, we want to focus on software creation, not games. This doesn’t mean that we will never release games again, but for now, we want to follow a new path for Léo Corporation. This path is impacted by global changes: We are living in an era where computers are now the center of our lives. The vision of Léo Corporation is to improve people’s productivity. We are doing this by releasing each year, new softwares and new experiences.\nThis means that there won’t be an “Educ’Maths 2022”, and the support of Educ’Maths games is going end sooner.\nFor players of Educ’Maths 2020, the end of support date is unchanged: On the 1st of December 2021, the support will end. This implies that Educ’Maths 2020 will no longer receive any updates, or patches.\nIf you are also a player of Educ’Maths 2021, the end of support has changed, and it will be the same as Educ’Maths 2020’s, the 1st of December 2021, a year earlier. Like Educ’Maths 2020, Educ’Maths 2021 will no longer receive any updates or patches, but you will still be able to play the game of course.\nThe end of support also means that you will no longer be able to download Educ’Maths from our website, or from Xalyus Store. About Xalyus Store, the “Games” category is also going away.\nWe would like to thank again everyone who played Educ’Maths games.\n","date":"2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/the-next-chapter-for-educmaths/","title":"The next chapter for Educ'Maths"},{"content":"A new version of Educ’Maths 2020 is now available, and it is the version 3.8.3.2107.\nChangelog Updated Updated the “About” page Updated links to Léo Corporation’s website Updated Léo Corporation’s logo in the “Settings” page Download Click here to download Educ’Maths 2020.\nScreenshot ","date":"2021-07-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/educmaths-2020-version-3832107-is-now/cover_hu1e462d6b39101058ec11703474115ecd_28321_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/educmaths-2020-version-3832107-is-now/","title":"Educ'Maths 2020: The version 3.8.3.2107 is now available"},{"content":"A new version of Gavilya is available, and it is the version 1.7.0.2107.\nChangelog New Added translations Added a placeholder in \u0026ldquo;GameInfoPage\u0026rdquo;

It came out with a brand-new design and brand features. Today, we are happy to introduce the next evolution of Xalyus Store.\nIntroduction When we started creating softwares, we always wanted a place where people could download them. We thought making a website was great, and we did so. But we also wanted a place on desktop, where we could showcase and display our apps. Therefore, we create a software called “Store”. With it, you could download any of our softwares directly from your computer. Then, we wanted to have a complete redesign of this app, and so we decided to modernize it by building a brand-new one: Xalyus Store.\nXalyus Store was our redesigned tore, with the same concepts but more polished. However, we encountered the same problem with the “Store”: If we want to add new softwares, update any informations, we needed to update Xalyus Store, which isn’t a great way of distributing new softwares. This is why we are here today, introducing the second major version of Xalyus Store.\nCompletely autonomous This next evolution of Xalyus Store is complete autonomous: You don’t have to update it to check if new softwares are available, everything is automatic! You may not see a lot of changes compared to the first version, but they are massive since it is about an entire new infrastructure and delivering system.\nModern design To keep our softwares consistent, the new Xalyus Store has a new and modern user interface, alongside with new themes.

Today, we are proud to announce the third version of ColorPicker, with a new design and new features.\nIntroduction ColorPicker was the first software for developers. Its goal was to empower a part of the development and/or design process: Color selection. Sometimes, when you want to use a color in a project, and you do not know any information about it, like the RGB values, or the HEX color code, it is very frustrating. Therefore, we created ColorPicker. ColorPicker’s main goal was to solve this problem. Using your mouse pointer, you could point a place on your screen, and get information about the color, at the time, you could only get RGB values. Then, we have released ColorPicker 2, with a new design and new features, like the new manual color-picking tool, and the possibility to get HEX color code. With ColorPicker 3, we wanted to put all this features you love, and make them even better.\nWhat is new? ColorPicker 3 introduces a brand-new design like Passliss’ design, with a navigation bar on the left, and the content on the other side. This minimalist approach is aiming to improve the user experience overall.\nColorPicker 3 also adds a new “Converter” page, to help you convert different color types easier. For instance, you can convert a RGB color to HEX and HSV.\nColorPicker 1 was only available in light mode, ColorPicker 2 was only available in dark mode, and ColorPicker is available in both. You can now set in ColorPicker’s settings if you want to use light or dark mode.\nOpen Source With this third version, we have decided to open-source ColorPicker 3, and the Git repository is – of course – available on GitHub.\nUpgrading ColorPicker 3 is not an update and will not be proposed as an update of ColorPicker 2. If you want to upgrade to ColorPicker 3, you will need to download and install ColorPicker 3. Also, ColorPicker 2’s support will end soon, so no more updates will be delivered to it.\nDownload Click here to download ColorPicker 3.\n","date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/04/introducing-colorpicker-3/cover_hu6d49e402343e0aa203165af3337feeff_37446_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/04/introducing-colorpicker-3/","title":"Introducing ColorPicker 3"},{"content":"A new version of Educ’Maths 2021 is available, and it is the version 4.2.0.2104.

This third version was designed to be built on a more modern platform (C# - Windows Forms) and also to deliver a more modern UI (Guna.UI) For Passliss, we chose to focus on one thing: innovation. Passliss is our second software to be built using WPF, and our first software to use our new design guidelines, which mainely focus on User eXperience (UX) but also on User Interface (UI). Thanks to this guidelines, Passliss is offering to our users an intuitive and modern experience.\nFeatures Passliss offers a few useful features to make password generation easier. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the password generation customization system, the main page. You an easily customize the password that isgoing to be generated, you can choose if the password will include lower case, upper case, numbers and special caracters. You can also choose the length of the password. You can save your configuration by using Password Configurations, which allows you to save a specific password generation configuration.\nPassliss can also evaluate the strenght of a password. There is multiples levels of strenght:\nLow, you should change your password Medium, adding more complexity to your password would be a nice addition Good, you can safely use this password Excellent, the chances of someone finding your password are near inexistant. Passliss also has an auto-update system and a dark mode!\nOpen Source Passliss is also Open Source on GitHub.\nDownload Click here to download Passliss.\n","date":"2021-02-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/introducing-passliss/cover_huffb5f60309ff2ea485e3f5e3b98d2e90_38472_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/introducing-passliss/","title":"Introducing Passliss"},{"content":"A new version of Xalyus Store is available and it\u0026rsquo;s the version 1.3.0.2102.\nChangelog New Added Passliss Updated Updated the icon Updated copyright Improved performance Removed Removed the \u0026ldquo;Suite\u0026rdquo; tab Download Click here to download Xalyus Store\nScreenshot ","date":"2021-02-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/xalyus-store-version-1302102-is-now/cover_hu55d80e60571c8baa380a19035745606f_54335_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/xalyus-store-version-1302102-is-now/","title":"Xalyus Store: The version 1.3.0.2102 is now available"},{"content":"2021 is going to be a big year for Léo Corporation.

There was two suite at the time: \u0026ldquo;Essential\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gestion\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;Hub\u0026rdquo; is similar to an app launcher. The first attempt failed, and so did the second. It failed because mainly of this two reasons:\nBad UI/UX (User Interface/User eXperience) Not enough promotion This is why, during summer 2020, we recreated completely the Essential suite under a new name, the Tooly Suite. This third version was shiped along a brand new design and user experience. Unfortunately, this third attempt also failed, mainly because there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of updates, and also because the concept wasn\u0026rsquo;t being promoted. This third attempt will be our last one as Leo Corporation is going in a new direction.\nWhat does the end of support means? It means that there won\u0026rsquo;t be any updates anymore, and you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to download the Tooly Suite. It will be removed from our website and Xalyus Store later this month.\nDoes this mean that I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use Tooly Suite? No. You can still continue to use it, but some features may not work in the future, like the auto-update system.\nAre you going to Open Source Tooly Suite? There is no plans yet to do so.\nMoving forward We acknowledge the failure of this concept, and we hope that we will learn from the mistakes made so this won\u0026rsquo;t reproduce in the future again.

Today, there is a lot of game launcher that you need to use depending on the game you wanna play. This is often annoying and this is why we created Gavilya.\nIntegrations and Features Gavilya uses the RAWG.io video games database to get all your games informations automatically. Gavilya uses the RAWG API to get the background image of a game, the game\u0026rsquo;s description and even on wich platforms the game is available on. If you think that the game found by Gavilya in the RAWG database is wrong, you can change the associated game in the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; window.\nYou can also know which games you played recently, or even know how long you\u0026rsquo;ve played a specific game. Gavilya uses a system that can detect if you are playing a game and count the time you\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it. Sometimes this system doesn\u0026rsquo;t works with games that have a different process name than it\u0026rsquo;s executable file (like Minecraft). This is why you can manually set the process to look for (for Minecraft it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;javaw\u0026rdquo;).\nOpen Source Gavilya is also one of our open-source projects. You can contribute to the code, report issues and bugs with Gavilya and more.
