[{"content":"Today, Léo Corporation unveils a new logo that reflects the end of GRP and the natural evolution that follows: the full centralization of projects, ideas, and ambitions under a single identity, Léo Corporation. Over time, our ecosystem has grown, shifted, and matured. Bringing everything together under one banner allows us to move forward with greater clarity, consistency, and focus.\nWhile the visual identity evolves, the spirit remains the same.

Today, we are announcing an important change. Due to a lack of time and available resources, GRP as a parent organization will be sunset.\nThis decision reflects the reality of maintaining several projects while trying to uphold the level of quality and long-term sustainability they deserve. Rather than allowing projects to slowly lose momentum, we believe it is more responsible to make this transition openly and clearly.\nAs a result, all GRP projects will be transferred to Léo Corporation. Some of them will continue to be maintained and improved under this new structure, while others will be officially discontinued. Among the projects that will no longer be maintained are Synapsy As A Service (which are now free) and Devyus. These projects will not receive further updates or support going forward.\nCentralizing development under Léo Corporation allows us to focus our efforts, reduce fragmentation, and ensure that the projects we continue to support can evolve in a stable and sustainable way. This shift also provides clearer direction for users and contributors, with a stronger emphasis on quality and long-term commitment.\nWe would like to sincerely thank everyone who has used, supported, or contributed to GRP projects over the years. Your interest and involvement made these initiatives possible. While this announcement marks the end of GRP as a parent organization, it also opens a new chapter focused on clarity, focus, and sustainability within Léo Corporation.\nWe already have retired the DevyusCode GitHub organization, moved the status page to status.leocorporation.dev, and are in the process of migrating other assets. GRP Accounts have also been removed and are no longer functional.\nMore information will be shared as the transition progresses and as the future of each project becomes clearer.\nLooking Ahead Léo Corporation remains committed to delivering high-quality software and services. We are excited about the opportunities this transition presents and look forward to continuing to serve our users with renewed focus and dedication. This year, we released several updates to Passliss, Qrix, and InternetTest Pro, and we have more planned for 2026 and beyond.\nStay tuned for more updates as we embark on this new journey together!\n","date":"2025-12-21T12:03:28+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2025/12/whats-next-for-l%C3%A9o-corporation-in-2026/cover_hu6d196bb22b9b1c7b23f3e615813baa6b_1192062_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2025/12/whats-next-for-l%C3%A9o-corporation-in-2026/","title":"What's next for Léo Corporation in 2026?"},{"content":"A new version of ColorPicker Max is now available.

This release is the result of a complete rewrite, moving to a modern MVVM architecture in WPF and adopting a new design language that fits naturally into Windows 11. The legacy code has been retired in favor of a cleaner, more maintainable structure that will make the project more reliable and future-proof.\nAt the visual level, every page has been redesigned. The application now uses a MicaWindow style, giving it a modern, lightweight look that integrates with the system theme and wallpaper. The overall navigation has been streamlined, and the interface is more consistent across features.\nNew Features Home page One of the most significant changes in InternetTest Pro 9 is the introduction of the new Home page. This redesigned entry point now provides all the key information about your current connection at a glance. It shows your connection status, WiFi network name, IP address, ISP details, DNS configuration, and speed. In addition, a recent activity section makes it possible to quickly review the last actions performed in the app, which is why the History page has been removed. The Home page is no longer just a landing screen; it is a complete dashboard that centralizes everything you need when launching the app.\nUnified WiFi Tools The WiFi experience has also been improved. In earlier versions, WiFi networks and WiFi password recovery were separate pages. They are now combined into a single page, offering a clearer and more coherent experience for managing wireless connections and recovering saved passwords.\nNew design All other tools have been modernized as well. The DNS Tool, Traceroute, Ping, and IPConfig pages have been redesigned with a more accessible interface, offering the same depth of information in a cleaner layout. These changes reflect an overall effort to unify the experience while keeping the functionality users rely on.\nRetired Features Some features have also been retired in this version. Synethia is no longer included, and support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 has been dropped. InternetTest Pro is now focused on Windows 10 and Windows 11, ensuring compatibility with modern technologies while allowing development to move forward without legacy constraints.\nRetrospective InternetTest has come a long way since its first release. The project started as a simple utility for testing whether your internet connection was working or not. Over time, more tools were added: DNS lookups, traceroute, ping, IP geolocation, and eventually WiFi utilities. Each version expanded its scope, gradually transforming InternetTest into a complete connectivity toolkit for Windows.\nWith InternetTest Pro, the application entered a new phase, providing not just isolated tools but a unified platform with a polished design and extended features. Version 9 represents another turning point, as the project undergoes its most ambitious rewrite to date. It brings together everything learned from previous versions into a refined experience that is faster, cleaner, and built for the future.\nDownload and Learn More InternetTest Pro 9 will be available for Windows 10 and Windows 11. To learn more about the project and its features, visit the official website or explore the source code on GitHub.\nThis release is more than just an update. It is the foundation for the next chapter of InternetTest, with a modern architecture, a unified design, and a focus on clarity and usability. Whether you are troubleshooting, monitoring, or simply exploring your connection, InternetTest Pro 9 provides the tools to understand and optimize your internet experience.\n","date":"2025-08-27T10:00:27+02:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2025/08/introducing-internettest-pro-9/cover_hua60010403a69e66b5871c7d451fa1960_812386_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2025/08/introducing-internettest-pro-9/","title":"Introducing InternetTest Pro 9"},{"content":"We are excited to announce the release of Gavilya version 4.7.0.2508, which includes a complete redesign of the Profile page and several new features to enhance your gaming experience.\nRedesigned Profile Page The most significant change in this version is the complete redesign of the Profile page.

That means while it might take some time for v9 to arrive, the groundwork we\u0026rsquo;re laying now will power a faster, smarter, and even more robust InternetTest experience moving forward.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s New in This Update We\u0026rsquo;ve refined network interface filtering, improving how we filter and display network information with .NET 9+.

Our DNS tools are stronger than ever with a new DNS Details Window, localized DNS Info Windows, and additional tooltips to make diagnosing DNS issues more intuitive. The user interface has also received a refresh with a brand-new theme, and the context menus have been upgraded with new styles and a \u0026ldquo;Copy\u0026rdquo; option to speed up workflow.\nBug Fixes and Improvements This update also fixes a few important issues.

Over the years, 7X has been the backbone supporting a wide range of powerful features like speed tests, DNS lookups, traceroutes, WiFi scanning, IP configuration details, website availability checks, and much more. With this final update, we wanted to polish the experience, fix lingering issues, and lay a smooth path toward what\u0026rsquo;s next.\nThe Road to InternetTest Pro 9 We\u0026rsquo;re already deep into planning v9. It won\u0026rsquo;t be just an incremental update — it will be a total rebuild. A new codebase, a new architecture, and a new future. This means a cleaner and faster foundation, better scalability for future features, stronger performance across devices, and even tighter integration with modern Windows technologies.

With each passing day, we entrust more of our personal and professional lives to the digital realm, necessitating the need for strong, unique passwords to safeguard our sensitive information. This fourth major version of Passliss is here to answer new needs when it comes to password generation. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what\u0026rsquo;s new!\nIntroducing Presets With Passliss for the Web 4, we are thrilled to introduce a groundbreaking new feature: Presets. Presets revolutionize the password generation experience by allowing users to create default configurations that align with their specific preferences and security needs. Gone are the days of manually adjusting settings for each password generation session—Presets streamline the process, ensuring that users can generate passwords tailored to their exact specifications with just a few clicks.\nCustomization Made Easy Presets empower users to customize every aspect of their password generation process, from the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters to the incorporation of numbers and special characters. Want a password that includes uppercase letters and numbers but excludes special characters? No problem. With Presets, users can effortlessly define their desired configuration, eliminating the need for repetitive adjustments.\nFine-Tuned Control What sets Presets apart is its granular level of control over password generation parameters. For each character type—uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters—users can set both a minimum and maximum number of characters to include in their passwords. This level of flexibility ensures that users can strike the perfect balance between complexity and memorability, catering to their individual preferences and security requirements.\nTarget Length Setting In addition to specifying the minimum and maximum character counts for each character type, Presets also allow users to set a target length for their passwords. Whether you prefer shorter, more concise passwords or longer, more robust ones, you can easily define your desired password length with a single setting. Presets then intelligently adjust the distribution of characters within the password to meet your specified target length, ensuring that each generated password is optimized for both security and usability.\nEffortless Password Generation With Presets, generating secure passwords has never been easier. Once users have configured their desired preset settings, they can simply select their preferred preset from the dropdown menu when generating a new password. Passliss for the Web 4 will then automatically apply the preset configuration, instantly generating a password that aligns with the user\u0026rsquo;s specifications. This streamlined process saves time and eliminates the guesswork, allowing users to focus on what matters most—keeping their online accounts secure.\nOther improvements We also took time to improve some areas of the app and improve existing features.

Since then, the app has undergone significant enhancements, embracing both new features and sleek designs.\nThe 2020 release, InternetTest 4, marked a notable milestone by incorporating advanced functionalities such as the IP Locator and Down Detector. Subsequently, in the following year, InternetTest 5 was unveiled, representing a major leap forward with a modernized codebase that laid the foundation for version 6.\nThe pinnacle of our journey arrived in 2022 with the launch of InternetTest Pro 7 – a revolutionary iteration that set itself apart from its predecessors. This version introduced groundbreaking features, including a WiFi password recovery utility, a fresh design, and a user-centric approach.\nToday, we are thrilled to present the latest advancement in the InternetTest series: InternetTest Pro 8. This iteration elevates your experience to unprecedented heights, building upon the legacy of its predecessors and delivering a seamless blend of cutting-edge features and user-friendly design.\nFeatures New dashboard We are proud to unveil the new InternetTest Pro 8 dashboard: We turned the home page of InternetTest to a place where you can quickly get the information your need at a glance. Indeed, we added a new information section where you can check the status of your connection, your network\u0026rsquo;s name and your public IP address. Furthermore, we decided to rethink the \u0026ldquo;Suggested actions\u0026rdquo; section by replacing it with \u0026ldquo;Quick action\u0026rdquo;: You can now easily run a speed test, recover lost WiFi passwords and connect to a network in just a few clicks. Alongside with these improvements you will also notice that we decided to improve the design of the feature cards, adding more depth to the app\u0026rsquo;s interface.\nHowever, you will notice that some of the features added to the dashboard were previously available in the \u0026ldquo;Status\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;My IP\u0026rdquo; page, and this is why we made the decision to remove theses two pages from the app. This change will make the app less crowded with basic pages that only included a single feature.\nRedesigned DownDetector page Previously, the DownDetector page posed challenges for new users due to its less-than-intuitive design, characterized by a cluttered UI with numerous elements. Recognizing the need for improvement, we took a fresh approach to this feature with the release of InternetTest Pro 8.\nIn our redesign, we have streamlined the user experience by introducing a more user-friendly interface. Now, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a designated box where you can input the URL of a website for inclusion in the verification process. This allows you to compile a list of websites that will undergo testing when you click the \u0026ldquo;Test all websites\u0026rdquo; button. On the left side, a new \u0026ldquo;Scheduled Tests\u0026rdquo; section has been incorporated, enabling you to efficiently schedule tests at specified intervals for seamless execution. With these enhancements, monitoring website performance has never been more straightforward and accessible.\nNew customization options With the features previously mentioned, we decided to add new customization options. In the settings of the app, you can now provide a default time interval to use when using scheduled tests in the DownDetector page. In addition, we also added the possibility to hide by default disabled network adapters in the WiFi Networks page.\nInstant theme switching InternetTest Pro 8 also brings a brand new theming system that is more flexible and dynamic. Indeed, you can now change the theme of the app without having to restart it. Speaking of theme, you will also notice that we updated to background mesh gradient for the main window. Plus, we redesigned some styles of navigation button making them more consistent with the rest of the app.\nImproved codebase When InternetTest Pro was launched in 2022, a standout addition was the incorporation of Synethia into the dashboard. Synethia, an algorithm designed to analyze user preferences within the app, utilized collected data(1) to craft a personalized dashboard. This tailored interface suggested the most relevant features based on individual usage patterns. Initially, the integration was manually executed without the official package, which is now offered by Devyus, the creators of Synethia.\nIn this 8th major version, we dedicated time to completely reworking the Synethia implementation, now leveraging the official Synthia package. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that upgrading from InternetTest Pro 7 will result in the loss of previously collected data.\nAdditionally, we invested effort in addressing numerous issues and bugs within the app, resulting in improved overall stability. These enhancements contribute to a more seamless and reliable user experience.\nPortable mode Introducing a new level of flexibility, InternetTest Pro 8 now offers users the choice between two distinct versions: Setup and Portable. The Setup version involves a traditional installation process, while the Portable option provides a convenient alternative, allowing users to run the app without the need for installation through a portable executable file. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that while Portable mode delivers heightened convenience, some features, such as automatic updates, are not available. For users opting for Portable mode, updating the application requires redownloading the updated portable executable file to ensure access to the latest enhancements. This choice empowers users to tailor their experience based on their preferences and usage requirements.\nGet the app InternetTest Pro is available on Windows and requires the .NET 6 Windows Desktop Runtime. Please note that in the future, we plan to upgrade to the .NET 8 Windows Desktop Runtime which will be needed to execute the app.\nClick here to get the Setup version of InternetTest Pro Click here to get the Portable version of InternetTest Pro (1): Synethia operates by collecting and storing data anonymously on your computer. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to underscore that no data is transmitted to Léo Corporation or any third-party entities.\n","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2024/01/introducing-internettest-pro-8/cover_hubc099fb848dc0f8510a05fa3ba86d443_965548_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2024/01/introducing-internettest-pro-8/","title":"Introducing InternetTest Pro 8"},{"content":"Last year, we concluded 2022 by telling you that 2023 was going to be super exciting - which is exactly what happened! This year has been a fantastic journey to be part of, and as the founder of the Léo Corporation, I can not express how I am grateful to you for this. I have personally never imagined that this project will come to this point, but here we are I guess. As the year ends, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look back at the major events and releases!\nThe creation of the Peyronnet Group In early 2023, Léo Corporation decided to create a specific branch for its developer-aimed products and libraies called Devyus. This subsidiary of Léo Corporation was intended to create and develop useful libraries for developers. Thanks to Devyus, our approach with LeoCorpLibrary evolved into PeyrSharp, and has also allowed a public release of our Synethia algorithm. But with the creation of Devyus, the internal organization of the Léo Corporation was becoming messy at a point where the following question arose: What is the goal of Léo Corporation? What do we create? The answer of this question could seem obvious at first - we create apps - but with Devyus, we were now also in charge of creating libraries for developers which are a different target from our apps\u0026rsquo;. This is why the Peyronnet Group was created: To provide a clear separation and definition of which entity\u0026rsquo;s goal was; Devyus is making developer tools, while Léo Corporation is creating applications and experiences. (Fun fact: Léo Corporation was supposed to be rebranded Léo\u0026rsquo;s Apps; however, the idea was abandoned for the simple reason that I thought the current name was already great)\nSince the creation of the Peyronnet Group, Léo Corporation has released many new products and applications, which proves that the change was also necessary to improve our productivity by removing some of the barriers that were previously in place. Let\u0026rsquo;s now take a look at these apps!\nNew applications ColorPicker Max In 2022, we released our most advanced app we ever made: InternetTest Pro. In 2023, we decided to do the same thing with ColorPicker by creating a powerful and advanced version of the app: ColorPicker Max. This version of ColorPicker is using the same UI as InternetTest Pro while bringing several tools for artists, designers, developers, and everyone who needs to manipulate colors. Today, ColorPicker Max is reliable tool and is one of our most popular app.\nDayBar DayBar is a simple app released during the summer to help you keep track of your time by displaying in your taskbar the percentage of the day that has passed. You can quickly check at a glance if you are productive enough. Currently, the app doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of features, but we already have plans for a v2 version that will come in 2024 hopefully.\nPermaTop It is often frustrating when managing multiple windows and you wish that one of them could stay on top of another one, but you can\u0026rsquo;t. With PermaTop, you can quickly pin any window so it stays on top of all other opened windows, which allows you to maximize your productivity by dismissing the need to switch between two different windows. This simple app was also released on summer and has received some updates to allow you to completely manage your windows using the app. If we have new ideas on how to improve the app, we will definitely release new updates to it next year.\nGavilya 4 Gavilya 4 is not really a new application since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring major new features or design compared to the last one, but this fourth major version is in fact a complete rewrite of the app from the ground up. Gavilya was the first WPF C# application I\u0026rsquo;ve made and the code base was getting old and also horrible to maintain. With the rewrite, the app is much faster and consumes less resources, which will definitely improve your experience.\nWeb experiences As you may have noticed, we didn\u0026rsquo;t talk about Passliss and Qrix in the previous section - this is because they are a new type of apps for us: Web applications. For the first time, we decided to abandon a Windows-only app for a cross-platform web application.\nPassliss Passliss is a simple password generator, but the following observation was made: If you want to generate a password, why install an app when alternatives already exist on the web? This is why we decided to stop the development of Passliss for Windows: To replace the app with a web app available on all devices. Despite some troubles while making the app, it is today very reliable and efficient, with new features and design. Passliss was one of our least popular app on GitHub - with the new strategy, it gained many stars, making it one of our most starred repo this year.\nQrix The same story also applies to Qrix (formerly known as Gerayis). We found absurd the need to install an app just to generate a QR Code, so we decided to create a web application that does the exact same thing the desktop version did, but better. We also brought a brand new design to make the app usable on any device.\nConclusion To round things up, 2023 was unlike any other and one of our biggest year so far with so many new innovations and novelties. I would like to conclude this year by thanking everyone who starred and contributed to our Open-Sourced projects on GitHub; without you some of the greatest apps and features would not have been possible. 2024 will be a year where we will focus on improving our products and I hope it will be as exciting as this year!\nThank you for being onboard with us on this journey,\nLéo, Founder of Léo Corporation.\n","date":"2023-12-29T17:58:28+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/12/2023-the-biggest-year-ever-for-l%C3%A9o-corporation/cover_hu9bd3ef99afe106b5f0739966ba933651_1075385_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/12/2023-the-biggest-year-ever-for-l%C3%A9o-corporation/","title":"2023 - The biggest year ever for Léo Corporation"},{"content":"A new version of ColorPicker Max is now available and it brings several improvements to the app.\nNew placeholder in AI page When starting the AI Generation page, a placeholder will now be displayed while the details panel is now hidden if no color is generated or selected.\nInstant theme switching You no longer need to restart the app to change its theme - the change is now reflected immediately.\nChangelog New Added the possibility to bookmark a color in Harmonies page (#351) Added translations (#352) Added placeholder in AI Page color section (#352) Added placeholder in AI Page palette section (#352) Added instant theme switching (#353) Fixed Fixed tab color issue when changing theme (#353) Fixed an issue with nav bar when switching theme (#353) Fixed color issue in dark theme Fixed transparent window issue Fixed theme not changing on first run Updated Updated Betalgo.OpenAI (#348) Updated PeyrSharp.Env (#349) Updated PeyrSharp.Core (#350) Updated theme file Download Click here to download ColorPicker Max.\nLearn More about ColorPicker Max.\n","date":"2023-12-10T13:07:13+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/12/colorpicker-version-5.8.0.2312-is-now-available/cover_huc3e0db47d93bc99cf1bdd729afba4126_1037332_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/12/colorpicker-version-5.8.0.2312-is-now-available/","title":"ColorPicker: Version 5.8.0.2312 is now available"},{"content":"A new version of Gavilya is available and it brings sa new favorite page and several improvements to the app. The features added in this version were brought by @Bamboooz.\nNew favorite page One of the most exciting features of this version of Gavilya is the new favorite page.

This version brings an exciting feature to Passliss: AI Password Generation!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new? Changelog New Added translations (#432) Added Password item component (#432) Added AI section in Generate page (#432) Added the possibility to set the OpenAI API key (#433) Added the possibility to generate a password with AI (#432) Added suggestions for new users (#434) Added UI when no API key is provided Added a loading UI (#435) Fixed Fixed an issue with AI settings Fixed an issue when the response isn\u0026rsquo;t properly formatted Updated Improved design of prompt item Updated dependencies Introducing AI password generation If you are like most people, you probably have dozens of online accounts that require passwords. And if you are like most people, you probably use the same password or a few variations of it for all your accounts. This is a bad practice that can compromise your security and privacy. But creating and remembering strong and unique passwords for each account is not easy either. That\u0026rsquo;s why we added artificial intelligence for password generation in Passliss, to create secure and memorable passwords for you.\nPassliss is powered by OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s GPT-3.5, one of the most advanced language model in the world. GPT-3.5 can generate natural and coherent text on any topic, given some keywords or a prompt. We use this technology to generate passwords that are not only strong and random, but also meaningful and easy to remember.\nHow does it work? It\u0026rsquo;s simple. Just go to our website and enter a prompt that is related to the account you want to create a password for. For example, if you want to create a password for your Netflix account, you can enter something like \u0026ldquo;I love watching movies and shows on Netflix\u0026rdquo;. Then, click on the \u0026ldquo;Generate\u0026rdquo; button and wait for a few seconds. Passliss will generate three passwords based on your prompt, each with a different level of security and memorability. You can choose the one that suits your needs best, or generate more passwords if you are not satisfied.\nHere are some examples of passwords generated by Passliss:\nPrompt: I love watching movies and shows on Netflix\nPasswords:\nM0v13L0v3r! N3tf1xAddict@ Str34m1ngQu33n! Prompt: My favorite sport is soccer and I play every weekend\nPasswords:\nS0cc3rW33k3nd Fav0rit3Sp0rt!2O2O PlayS0cc3rZzZ Prompt: I am a fan of Harry Potter and my favorite character is Hermione\nPasswords:\nH3rmi0n3P0tter Grang3rW1zard Mudbl00dGryffind0r As you can see, Passliss can generate passwords that are related to your interests and hobbies, making them easier to recall. Of course, you should always use a password manager to store and manage your passwords securely.

Look no further than Passliss for the Web, the latest and greatest iteration of Léo Corporation\u0026rsquo;s simple yet powerful password generator.\nNew features The new Home page With Passliss for the Web, you can generate a strong password with just a click of a button. The home dashboard allows for quick generation, giving you the option to generate a password as soon as you load the page or by clicking a button. Plus, with the recommended features displayed as cards, you can easily explore and customize your password to fit your needs.\nIntroducing Activities The Activity page in Passliss for the Web allows you to keep track of all the passwords you\u0026rsquo;ve generated so far. This feature provides you with a list of your recently generated passwords along with their strength ratings. With this information at your fingertips, you can quickly identify which passwords are weak and need to be updated.\nGenerate passwords easily The Generate page in Passliss for the Web is designed to make password generation easy and customizable. The basic view allows you to generate a password by strength, where you can select the desired strength with a slider and generate and copy buttons. The password strength rating is displayed in real-time, allowing you to adjust the strength slider to your desired level.\nHowever, if you want more control over your passwords, the advanced view is where you should be. Here, you can customize the password characters to your liking, including uppercases, lowercases, numbers, and special characters. You can even input custom characters to create unique passwords. Additionally, you can choose the length of the password and generate multiple passwords at once. Whether you want a quick and easy password or a fully customized one, Passliss for the Web has you covered.\nEnsure your safety But Passliss for the Web doesn\u0026rsquo;t just stop at password generation. The strength page allows you to estimate the strength of your current passwords and provides you with a detailed view of their strength with different colors. With this feature, you can identify weak passwords and take action to make them stronger. Passliss for the Web reminds you that the strength estimation is just an estimate, so you should always use your best judgment when creating and using passwords.\nEncrypt your secrets Passliss also has another great feature: The encryption page. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt strings using different encryption algorithms, including AES and Triple-DES. These are widely recognized as some of the most secure and reliable encryption algorithms available today.\nAES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that is used to protect sensitive data. It is widely considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available, and is used by governments, financial institutions, and other organizations to secure their data.\nTriple-DES, or Triple Data Encryption Standard, is another symmetric-key encryption algorithm that uses three individual keys for increased security. While it is not as widely used as AES, it is still a reliable encryption algorithm that provides strong protection for your data.\nCustomize your experience Passliss for the Web also comes with a settings page, allowing you to set your preferred theme, language, default random length, list of characters, and even your default encryption algorithm. And with the ability to export and import settings, you can easily transfer your preferences to other devices.\nBuilt using innovative technologies Built using NextJS, TypeScript, and Shadcn/ui with TailwindCSS and RadixUI, Passliss for the Web is also a progressive web application available for both desktop and mobile devices. Plus, the responsive UI ensures a seamless experience across all devices.\nLaunch now! Don\u0026rsquo;t settle for weak and easily hackable passwords. Upgrade to Passliss for the Web and secure your online presence today!\nClick here to launch Passliss in your browser.\nTrailer Watch the trailer!\nQnA What’s the future of Passliss Desktop? Passliss Desktop is going to be discontinued in favor of Passliss for the Web. This means that users will need to use the new web experience to generate and manage their passwords. Passliss for the Web offers more features, more security, and more convenience than Passliss Desktop.\nHowever, users can still enjoy a desktop-like experience by installing Passliss for the Web as a progressive web application (PWA). This will allow them to access Passliss for the Web from their desktop or mobile device without opening a browser. To install Passliss for the Web as a PWA, users simply need to visit the website and follow the instructions on their device.\nWe hope that users will enjoy using Passliss for the Web and appreciate its benefits over Passliss Desktop. We thank them for their support and feedback over the years and look forward to providing them with the best password generator possible.\nCan I upgrade directly from Passliss Desktop to Passliss for the Web? No, you cannot upgrade from Passliss Desktop to Passliss Web because they are two different products. Passliss Desktop is a standalone application that runs on Windows and generates passwords locally. Passliss Web is a web-based application that runs on any device with a browser and generates passwords online. They have different features, settings, and interfaces.\nHowever, you can still use both products if you wish. You can keep using Passliss Desktop until it is discontinued and then switch to Passliss Web. Or you can start using Passliss Web right away and enjoy its benefits over Passliss Desktop. The choice is yours.\nIs Passliss for the Web free? Yes, Passliss for the Web is free and open source. You can use it without paying anything or registering anything. You can also access the source code and contribute to the development of Passliss for the Web on GitHub. We believe in making password security accessible and transparent for everyone.\n","date":"2023-03-23T13:07:30+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/introducing-passliss-for-the-web-the-ultimate-password-generator/cover_hu49425ef23b9ba42a7bec51708c9fe753_1002700_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/introducing-passliss-for-the-web-the-ultimate-password-generator/","title":"Introducing Passliss for the Web – The Ultimate Password Generator"},{"content":"A new version of Gavilya is now available, and it is the version 3.3.0.2303.\nChangelog New Added translations (#348) Added the possibility to choose a game randomly on Home (#348) Added the possibility to choose a game randomly on Library (#348) Redesigned the recently played page (#349) Empty sections in Recent are hidden (#349) Filter button is only visible when the search box is focused (#351) Fixed Fixed an issue with achievement image Search selected item should always be visible (#350) Updated Updated PeyrSharp.Core (#346) Updated PeyrSharp.Env (#347) Download Click here to download Gavilya.\nWebsite Click here to go the website of Gavilya.\nScreenshot ","date":"2023-03-12T13:41:10+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/gavilya-version-3.3.0.2303-is-now-available/cover_hu3cd9e2252db0a422f83e35dfd91af341_1060863_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/gavilya-version-3.3.0.2303-is-now-available/","title":"Gavilya: Version 3.3.0.2303 is now available"},{"content":"A new version of InternetTest Pro is now available and brings new features and improvements.\nChangelog New Added translations (#403) Added the possibility to filter history by state (#403) Added the possibility to copy the details in DownDetector (#404) Added the possibility to copy the details in Locate IP (#404) Added the possibility to copy the details in My IP (#404) Added the possibility to copy the details in Ping (#404) Added the possibility to copy the details in Status (#404) Added the possibility to enable confidential mode by default (#405) Added translations (#406) Added the possibility to get the \u0026ldquo;technical\u0026rdquo; information of request (#406) Added the possibility to remember the \u0026ldquo;pin\u0026rdquo; state (#407) Updated Updated PeyrSharp.Core (#401) Updated PeyrSharp.Env (#402) Download Click here to download InternetTest.\nScreenshot ","date":"2023-03-12T12:15:58+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/internettest-version-7.4.0.2303-is-now-available/cover_hubc099fb848dc0f8510a05fa3ba86d443_913430_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/internettest-version-7.4.0.2303-is-now-available/","title":"InternetTest: Version 7.4.0.2303 is now available"},{"content":"A new version of PeyrSharp is now available, and it is the version 1.4.0.2303.\nPeyrSharp.Core New Added CaloriesToJoules() method (#79) Added JoulesToCalories() method (#79) Added KnotsToKilometersPerHour() method (#80) Added KilometersPerHourToKnots() method (#80) Added KnotsToMilesPerHour() method (#81) Added MilesPerHourToKnots() method (#81) Added KilometersPerHourToMetersPerSecond() method (#82) Added MetersPerSecondToKilometersPerHour() method (#82) Added MilesPerHourToKilometersPerHour() (#83) Added KilometersPerHourToMilesPerHour() (#83) PeyrSharp.Extensions New Added the Reverse() extension method (string) (#78) NuGet Packages PeyrSharp PeyrSharp.Core PeyrSharp.Enums PeyrSharp.Env PeyrSharp.Exceptions PeyrSharp.Extensions PeyrSharp.UiHelpers Links Documentation GitHub GitHub Packages ","date":"2023-03-05T14:21:49+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/peyrsharp-version-1.4.0.2303-is-now-available/cover_hufdf0db24a1768dd3a6128eb0a42fdc31_703606_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/03/peyrsharp-version-1.4.0.2303-is-now-available/","title":"PeyrSharp: Version 1.4.0.2303 is now available"},{"content":"Introduction ColorPicker Max is the latest version of the popular color picker tool that has been trusted by designers, artists, and developers around the world. As the next major evolution of this application, ColorPicker Max introduces a host of new features and improvements that make it more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly than ever before. In this article, we will take a closer look at the newest features and enhancements that make ColorPicker Max the ultimate choice for anyone who needs to work with color on a daily basis. From the powerful Converter tool to the versatile Gradient generator, we will explore all the ways in which ColorPicker Max can help you work more efficiently and effectively with color. So let\u0026rsquo;s dive in and discover what this amazing tool has to offer!\nSelector One of the most exciting features of ColorPicker Max is its ability to select a specific color using different sliders or from a pixel on the screen. This allows users to easily and accurately pick any color they need for their projects. Additionally, the color detail panel shows all the details of the color, including RGB values, HEX, HSL, HSV, CMYK, XYZ, YIQ, and YUV. Users can also copy any of these values to the clipboard by simply clicking on them.\nChromatic wheel Another great feature of ColorPicker Max is its Chromatic Wheel, which allows users to select a color from the wheel, with the ability to choose different chromatic wheels. The tool also includes a converter that lets users enter a color using a specified color type, and then shows the color converted in all color types, making it easy to find the color you need.\nConverter ColorPicker Max offers several useful tools for manipulating colors, and two of the most powerful are the Converter and Text tools.\nThe Converter tool allows users to easily convert colors between different color types, such as RGB, HEX, HSV, HSL, CMYK, YIQ, XYZ, and YUV. Users can enter a color using a specified color type, and the tool will automatically display the color converted into all other color types in a color detail panel. If the user enters an invalid color, a message will appear to let them know.\nFor some color types, the Converter tool also displays dedicated textboxes that allow users to enter different values for each variable, such as hue, saturation, and value. The tool also provides a preview of the color specified by the user.\nText tool The Text tool is another powerful feature of ColorPicker Max that allows users to set the font, font size, foreground color, and background color for text. The tool also includes a feature that calculates the contrast ratio between the foreground and background colors and displays it as an arrow on a scale, indicating whether the contrast is sufficient for legibility.\nWith the Text tool, users can set the color for both regular text and links, and the tool includes a preview of the resulting text as it will appear on a webpage. The ability to set custom font and color styles can be incredibly useful for web designers, graphic designers, and anyone else who needs to manipulate colors and text on a regular basis.\nIn short, both the Converter and Text tools are powerful and flexible features that can greatly enhance a user\u0026rsquo;s ability to work with and manipulate colors. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a designer, developer, or simply someone who enjoys exploring the world of color, ColorPicker Max has everything you need to get the most out of your work.\nPalette and Gradient ColorPicker Max also offers a variety of tools for creating color palettes and gradients. The palette tool lets users get different shades, brightness, and hues of a specified color, and also provides the ability to bookmark and save the palette for later. The gradient tool allows users to generate a random gradient with two stops, change the rotation of the gradient, and even export the gradient as CSS.\nBookmarks ColorPicker Max allows you to bookmark your favorite colors, palettes, and gradients, making it easy to quickly access them later on. You can organize your bookmarks into different categories, such as regular colors, palettes, and gradients, and easily remove individual bookmarks or clear all bookmarks at once.\nTo add a bookmark, simply navigate to the color, palette, or gradient you\u0026rsquo;d like to save and click the bookmark icon. You can access your bookmarks at any time by clicking on the Bookmarks button in the sidebar, and then selecting the category you\u0026rsquo;d like to view.\nBookmarks make it easy to keep track of your favorite color schemes and design elements, allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively.\nModern experience The user interface and user experience of ColorPicker Max are both top-notch. The background is a mesh gradient with subtle colors that adapts to the light or dark theme, while the window is resizable and responsive. The tool also includes a dashboard with the most relevant features for the user and a section for least relevant features, making it easy to find what you need.\nIn conclusion, ColorPicker Max is an excellent tool for developers, designers, and anyone else who needs to work with colors regularly. Its range of features and ease of use make it a must-have for anyone who wants to work with colors more efficiently. Try ColorPicker Max today and experience the difference for yourself!\nDownload To get started with ColorPicker Max, head to our website and download the installation package. The app is available for Windows.\nOnce the installation package has finished downloading, double-click it to begin the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\nOnce installed, you can launch ColorPicker Max from your applications folder or the Start menu. When you launch the app for the first time, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to choose your default language, theme, and other settings.\nHow to upgrade from ColorPicker 4? It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that ColorPicker Max is not simply an upgrade to ColorPicker 4. While it does share some similarities with its predecessor, ColorPicker Max is a standalone application that needs to be installed manually. Users of ColorPicker 4 will not be able to upgrade to ColorPicker Max through their current application and will need to download and install ColorPicker Max separately.\nDespite the need for a manual installation, we believe that the new features and enhancements offered by ColorPicker Max make it worth the effort. The powerful and flexible new tools, as well as the improved user interface and user experience, are designed to help users work more efficiently and effectively with color. So, if you\u0026rsquo;re ready to take your color work to the next level, we encourage you to download and install ColorPicker Max today.\nVideo Check the official trailer for ColorPicker Max.\n","date":"2023-02-17T12:57:52+01:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/02/introducing-colorpicker-max/cover_huc3e0db47d93bc99cf1bdd729afba4126_1063495_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2023/02/introducing-colorpicker-max/","title":"Introducing ColorPicker Max"},{"content":"A new version of Gerayis is now available, and it is the version 2.4.0.2302.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new?

We are developing apps and services in C# .NET, and we know it can be frustrating sometimes. We, as software developers, always had this though: “if only they were a library for this.” Therefore, in March 2020, we published LeoCorpLibrary, which was a C# library that contained useful methods. When we started the development of it, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know where the project will go yet. Over the releases, we\u0026rsquo;ve added more and more methods and new features. However, the meaning and the purpose of LeoCorpLibrary was becoming less clear for everyone; it was becoming a mess. This is why we decided to rather not release it fifth version, but instead, we decided to make a brand-new .NET Library, PeyrSharp.\nWhat is PeyrSharp? PeyrSharp is a C# written library designed to make developers\u0026rsquo; life easier. We\u0026rsquo;ve all written code that we wish we hadn\u0026rsquo;t. PeyrSharp is here to respond to this need; by implementing useful methods in various domains: Mathematics, Web/HTTP requests, unit converters, extensions, environment-related operations, and more!\nA new way to use a library Unlike LeoCorpLibrary, PeyrSharp is divided in multiples packages:\nCore - the basic methods and features of PeyrSharp Env - methods related to the file system and to the current execution environment. Enums - all enumerations used by PeyrSharp Exceptions - all exceptions used by PeyrSharp Extensions - extension methods that extends basic types such as string, int, double or arrays (T[]). UiHelpers - methods related to Windows Forms or to the Windows Presentation Framework (WPF). All of these modules are included in PeyrSharp; however, PeyrSharp.UiHelpers is only included if you download the package on Windows.\nCompatibility Some modules of PeyrSharp are targeting features only available in specific operating systems. Thus, some packages aren\u0026rsquo;t available on all platforms.\nPackage/Platform Windows macOS Linux + others Core ✅ ✅ ✅ Env ✅ ⚠️ ⚠️ Enums ✅ ✅ ✅ Exceptions ✅ ✅ ✅ Extensions ✅ ✅ ✅ UiHelpers ✅ ❌ ❌ Caption:\n✅ Full Support ⚠️ Partial Support ❌ Unsupported platform Frameworks PeyrSharp is designed to be a modern library, therefore, we decided to ditch support for .NET Framework and .NET Core in favor of .NET 5, 6 and 7.\nNote: .NET Framework and .NET Core are not targeted by PeyrSharp, since they are no longer supported.\nDocumentation PeyrSharp has a documentation, making it easy for developers to use it.

Gavilya 3 now features a sidebar where you can find the home page, your games, those you played recently, and also your favorites. You can access you notifications directly from sidebar too. Located on the left side of the app, the sidebar gathers all of Gavilya\u0026rsquo;s features in one place. With the new sidebar, all buttons and menus in the title bar have been removed.\nImproved profiles Profiles are an important feature of Gavilya. In version 3, the profile experience has been improved; we merged your profile page with the profile switcher, making it easier than ever to create and manage profiles in Gavilya.\nModern settings The settings window of Gavilya wasn\u0026rsquo;t really intuitive; therefore, we completely re-imagined the settings experience. Settings can now be access straight from the sidebar, and it will shows up in a new page instead of a window. You can now focus more on what you want to do with the new settings page design: It\u0026rsquo;s simple and intuitive. The design is similar to the one used in our other apps.\nNew card view We\u0026rsquo;ve also redesigned a key part of Gavilya: The card view. You will notice that the play button is no longer visible by default: To bring it back, simply hover the card and it will show up again. When hovering a card, you can also now see the name of the game at a glance.\nSorting options We\u0026rsquo;ve also added sorting options to Gavilya: You can sort your games by the alphabetical order or not.\nOther improvements We\u0026rsquo;ve also improved the design consistency across all the pages of Gavilya.

We are experience creators, and we are more than happy to share with you the pioneer of a new era, InternetTest Pro.\nA new and improved user interface InternetTest Pro, also called InternetTest 7, offers a new user interface; you will notice a brand-new side bar with “pinned” actions and different menus. You can access your favorite functionalities using this new side bar, or by using the “Home” dashboard; it is a place specially made for you where you can quickly find useful actions and features. We have added subtle animations as well.\nWe are also introducing an improved light and dark theme; the background of the window is no longer white: Instead, there is a subtle mesh gradient with different colors. The accent color is also more used in different part of the app. Finally, you will notice that there are less shades of gray, and more shades of blue used everywhere in InternetTest.\nAn experience conceived for you We want our users to have the best experience possible when they use our apps. We believe that our products should adapt to their needs, and that our users should not have to adapt to the limitations of our applications. Therefore, we want to introduce you Synethia, an algorithm that can understand your habits and which features you’d like to use. When you are using InternetTest Pro, Synethia will collect data on how you spent time with each feature, and which interactions you have made. The data is then analyzed, and this how the “Home” dashboard shows you recommended actions and features. The more you use InternetTest Pro, the more Synethia will be able to understand your needs.\nNow, we are aware that this feature will raise privacy concerns about the data collected, and we want to be fully transparent with you. The data is stored on your device anonymously and is NOT send to Léo Corporation. It is NOT used by any third-party application or company other than InternetTest itself. You have full control over your data; you can reset it or erase it completely. You can, at any time, disable Synethia in the Settings. Synethia cannot interact with other apps or program.\nA new set of features InternetTest Pro has all the features included in InternetTest 6, which are: Connection Status, Down Detector, My IP, and Locate an IP. With this new version we are introducing three new features: Ping, IP Config, and WiFi Passwords (recovery).\nPing The Ping feature allows you to send a ping request to specified IP address or URL. It works exactly like the “ping” command in Windows. You can get useful information when you make a ping, such as the maximum/minimum and average duration of each request, the number of packages sent, received, or lost, and the IP address if you provided an URL.\nIP Config The IP Config feature works the same as the “ipconfig” command available in the Windows command prompt. You will be able to get a list of all the network interfaces registered on your system. By default, only the connected interfaces details are expanded. You can copy the information of each interface. This information contains: Status (connected/disconnected), the DNS Suffix, the local IPv4 and IPv6 address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway IP address (in IPv4 and IPv6).\nWiFi Passwords This feature allows you to recover all passwords of all the WiFi networks you have already been connected to. By default, the page is empty for security reasons, you will need to click on the “Get locally stored networks” button to see all registered networks on your device. You can then expand each network details to learn more about the encryption algorithm, the authentication mode, the connection type/mode, and most importantly, the network key. The key is hidden by default; click on the “eye” icon next to it to show the key.\nA new history We are also glad to announce a unified history page. On this page you will be able to see the results of each test made using the “Status” or “Down Detector” feature. You can erase the history at any time.\nSimplified settings We are also committed to improvements of the settings page: Some sections are gone because we grouped them in a single category. For example, the default test website and the default HTTP protocol are now in the same “Web” category. The update system has also been reworked, so you can quickly see if InternetTest Pro is up to date or not. The theme and the default page picker have all been simplified.\nWhat is next for InternetTest 6? The support for InternetTest 6 will end; it won’t receive new features anymore. InternetTest Pro will not be offered as an upgrade of InternetTest 6 because we consider it as a different product. We will let our users choose whether they want to upgrade or not.\nDownload Click here to explore your new experience with InternetTest Pro.\nVideo Check the official trailer for InternetTest Pro.\n","date":"2022-08-26T11:19:43+02:00","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/08/introducing-internettest-pro/cover_hu7b31d3fb5bf90cfe747d085347192ded_871883_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/08/introducing-internettest-pro/","title":"Introducing InternetTest Pro"},{"content":"Today, we are releasing a huge update to our blog: We are switching from Blogger to Hugo, a static website generator. This change will give us more control over our content and makes it easier to publish new and exciting articles.\nWhat is new? The blog is now using a modern responsive theme that support both light and dark mode. We are introducing “Categories”; it is a new way to sort articles. There is now a table of content in every article, you can also see the estimated reading time next to the date. We have added links to our socials as well, and a brand new About page too.\nWhat is gone? With this new update, we have decided it is the best time to move on, so our older articles from 2018 to 2020, are no longer available, but they still are on the old blog which will stay accessible.\nWhat is next? We hope that you will like the modern design; we are excited to post new and better articles on this blog, as a big announcement is coming soon.\n","date":"2022-08-24T09:33:41+02:00","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/08/our-new-blog/","title":"Our New Blog"},{"content":"A new version of Datalya is now available, and it is the version 1.6.0.2208.\nChangelog New Added \u0026ldquo;Re-order\u0026rdquo;

As you may have noticed, we’ve updated our font in our logos and websites. We are announcing that we’re ditching the Montserrat font for Hauora Sans. This font gives more personality to our identity, since the old font was one of the most popular sans serif fonts used in apps, websites, and product. The new one is – indeed – like Montserrat, but it adds some small details that makes it better than the old one.\nWhen will this change take effect? As we said, most of our websites have already received an update. However, our apps haven’t yet.

They were specialized database management tools. They provided a brand new and modern user interface at the time. The goal was to rewrite the codebase from Visual Basic to C#, to introduce new features and a new design language. However, these two softwares were only available in French, not in English, and they weren’t receiving updates as much as other Léo Corporation’s softwares. This is why we are today introducing the next generation of database management at Léo Corporation: Datalya.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Datalya? Datalya is a modern and yet simple database management software for Windows. The main innovation of Datalya is Blocks. Blocks are different types of input for a user. For instance, you can have a simple text input, to a checkbox input, without forgetting the dropdown input. These Blocks are customizable, you can name theme, add choices, and more. You can even export your Blocks as a Template, so you can reuse them quickly in other databases. In a nutshell, Blocks are used to create your Database.\nYou can find Blocks in the “Creator” part. Talking about parts, Datalya is divided into two parts: The Creator part, and the Database part. We’ve talked about the Creator part already, so let’s move on to the Database part.\nThe Database part is where the database is. You’ll notice a ribbon UI at the top, and the database’s content filling the rest of the window. By default, it’s empty: Indeed, we need to add an item to the database first. You can go to “Edit” tab in the ribbon, and then click on “Add”. You’ll see that a window with your Blocks has appeared, and in this window, you can fill the fields and then add the item.\nOnce you’ve added the item, you can edit it, delete it, etc.\nThe other new feature is the possibility to export a database to an Excel spreadsheet. You can go to the “Export” tab of the ribbon and click on “Export to Excel”. Note that Datalya only supports .xlsx files.\nWhen launching Datalya, you’ll see the home screen, this is where all your recent files are shown for you to jump into a database quickly. You can even pin your most important databases if you have a lot of them.\nDatalya is also customizable: it is available in English and French, and it has a dark mode! You can also change update settings and reset them anytime.\nThere is still a lot of features that we didn’t covered in this article, but we will let you discover them by yourself. We’ve been working on Datalya for a few months now, and we focused on the design and on the user experience with the product, to deliver you an enjoyable experience while working on a database.\nAs always, Datalya will be free and Open-Source.\nWhat’s next for GestionBiblio X and GestionPerso X The release of Datalya also means that our old GestionBiblio X and GestionPerso X softwares are now deprecated, and we recommend that the users of theses products switch to Datalya. If you are a user of one of these products, you can create a new database in Datalya by selecting ether the “Books” template or the “People” template.\nWebsite Click here to go the website of Datalya.\nDownload Click here to download Datalya.\n","date":"2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/introducing-datalya/cover_hu585b845bac6b9b98f4e385dce7b37f4b_23177_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/introducing-datalya/","title":"Introducing Datalya"},{"content":"Educ’Maths was a game to test your knowledge in math. It was developed back in 2018, and was released under the name “Educ’Maths”, and later renamed “Educ’Maths 2018”. At the time, Educ’Maths was one of our first and biggest software we’ve ever released. Then, Educ’Maths became a series of games: Educ’Maths 2019, 2020, and finally, 2021. For each edition, we tried to push the limit of the previous one, and we went from a simple quiz game to an interactive and fun game in 2021. In June 2021, 23% of downloaded softwares were Educ’Maths games.\nHowever, we have decided to end the Educ’Maths series here.\nIn previous blog articles, we told you that 2021 is going to be a big year for Léo Corporation, and indeed, we’ve release in 2021 more softwares and software updates than ever. Our vision has through the years evolved, and today, we want to focus on software creation, not games. This doesn’t mean that we will never release games again, but for now, we want to follow a new path for Léo Corporation. This path is impacted by global changes: We are living in an era where computers are now the center of our lives. The vision of Léo Corporation is to improve people’s productivity. We are doing this by releasing each year, new softwares and new experiences.\nThis means that there won’t be an “Educ’Maths 2022”, and the support of Educ’Maths games is going end sooner.\nFor players of Educ’Maths 2020, the end of support date is unchanged: On the 1st of December 2021, the support will end. This implies that Educ’Maths 2020 will no longer receive any updates, or patches.\nIf you are also a player of Educ’Maths 2021, the end of support has changed, and it will be the same as Educ’Maths 2020’s, the 1st of December 2021, a year earlier. Like Educ’Maths 2020, Educ’Maths 2021 will no longer receive any updates or patches, but you will still be able to play the game of course.\nThe end of support also means that you will no longer be able to download Educ’Maths from our website, or from Xalyus Store. About Xalyus Store, the “Games” category is also going away.\nWe would like to thank again everyone who played Educ’Maths games.\n","date":"2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/the-next-chapter-for-educmaths/","title":"The next chapter for Educ'Maths"},{"content":"A new version of Educ’Maths 2020 is now available, and it is the version 3.8.3.2107.\nChangelog Updated Updated the “About” page Updated links to Léo Corporation’s website Updated Léo Corporation’s logo in the “Settings” page Download Click here to download Educ’Maths 2020.\nScreenshot ","date":"2021-07-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/educmaths-2020-version-3832107-is-now/cover_hu1e462d6b39101058ec11703474115ecd_28321_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/07/educmaths-2020-version-3832107-is-now/","title":"Educ'Maths 2020: The version 3.8.3.2107 is now available"},{"content":"A new version of Gavilya is available, and it is the version 1.7.0.2107.\nChangelog New Added translations Added a placeholder in \u0026ldquo;GameInfoPage\u0026rdquo;

It came out with a brand-new design and brand features. Today, we are happy to introduce the next evolution of Xalyus Store.\nIntroduction When we started creating softwares, we always wanted a place where people could download them. We thought making a website was great, and we did so. But we also wanted a place on desktop, where we could showcase and display our apps. Therefore, we create a software called “Store”. With it, you could download any of our softwares directly from your computer. Then, we wanted to have a complete redesign of this app, and so we decided to modernize it by building a brand-new one: Xalyus Store.\nXalyus Store was our redesigned tore, with the same concepts but more polished. However, we encountered the same problem with the “Store”: If we want to add new softwares, update any informations, we needed to update Xalyus Store, which isn’t a great way of distributing new softwares. This is why we are here today, introducing the second major version of Xalyus Store.\nCompletely autonomous This next evolution of Xalyus Store is complete autonomous: You don’t have to update it to check if new softwares are available, everything is automatic! You may not see a lot of changes compared to the first version, but they are massive since it is about an entire new infrastructure and delivering system.\nModern design To keep our softwares consistent, the new Xalyus Store has a new and modern user interface, alongside with new themes.

Today, we are proud to announce the third version of ColorPicker, with a new design and new features.\nIntroduction ColorPicker was the first software for developers. Its goal was to empower a part of the development and/or design process: Color selection. Sometimes, when you want to use a color in a project, and you do not know any information about it, like the RGB values, or the HEX color code, it is very frustrating. Therefore, we created ColorPicker. ColorPicker’s main goal was to solve this problem. Using your mouse pointer, you could point a place on your screen, and get information about the color, at the time, you could only get RGB values. Then, we have released ColorPicker 2, with a new design and new features, like the new manual color-picking tool, and the possibility to get HEX color code. With ColorPicker 3, we wanted to put all this features you love, and make them even better.\nWhat is new? ColorPicker 3 introduces a brand-new design like Passliss’ design, with a navigation bar on the left, and the content on the other side. This minimalist approach is aiming to improve the user experience overall.\nColorPicker 3 also adds a new “Converter” page, to help you convert different color types easier. For instance, you can convert a RGB color to HEX and HSV.\nColorPicker 1 was only available in light mode, ColorPicker 2 was only available in dark mode, and ColorPicker is available in both. You can now set in ColorPicker’s settings if you want to use light or dark mode.\nOpen Source With this third version, we have decided to open-source ColorPicker 3, and the Git repository is – of course – available on GitHub.\nUpgrading ColorPicker 3 is not an update and will not be proposed as an update of ColorPicker 2. If you want to upgrade to ColorPicker 3, you will need to download and install ColorPicker 3. Also, ColorPicker 2’s support will end soon, so no more updates will be delivered to it.\nDownload Click here to download ColorPicker 3.\n","date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/04/introducing-colorpicker-3/cover_hu6d49e402343e0aa203165af3337feeff_37446_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/04/introducing-colorpicker-3/","title":"Introducing ColorPicker 3"},{"content":"A new version of Educ’Maths 2021 is available, and it is the version 4.2.0.2104.

This third version was designed to be built on a more modern platform (C# - Windows Forms) and also to deliver a more modern UI (Guna.UI) For Passliss, we chose to focus on one thing: innovation. Passliss is our second software to be built using WPF, and our first software to use our new design guidelines, which mainely focus on User eXperience (UX) but also on User Interface (UI). Thanks to this guidelines, Passliss is offering to our users an intuitive and modern experience.\nFeatures Passliss offers a few useful features to make password generation easier. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the password generation customization system, the main page. You an easily customize the password that isgoing to be generated, you can choose if the password will include lower case, upper case, numbers and special caracters. You can also choose the length of the password. You can save your configuration by using Password Configurations, which allows you to save a specific password generation configuration.\nPassliss can also evaluate the strenght of a password. There is multiples levels of strenght:\nLow, you should change your password Medium, adding more complexity to your password would be a nice addition Good, you can safely use this password Excellent, the chances of someone finding your password are near inexistant. Passliss also has an auto-update system and a dark mode!\nOpen Source Passliss is also Open Source on GitHub.\nDownload Click here to download Passliss.\n","date":"2021-02-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/introducing-passliss/cover_huffb5f60309ff2ea485e3f5e3b98d2e90_38472_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/introducing-passliss/","title":"Introducing Passliss"},{"content":"A new version of Xalyus Store is available and it\u0026rsquo;s the version 1.3.0.2102.\nChangelog New Added Passliss Updated Updated the icon Updated copyright Improved performance Removed Removed the \u0026ldquo;Suite\u0026rdquo; tab Download Click here to download Xalyus Store\nScreenshot ","date":"2021-02-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/xalyus-store-version-1302102-is-now/cover_hu55d80e60571c8baa380a19035745606f_54335_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/xalyus-store-version-1302102-is-now/","title":"Xalyus Store: The version 1.3.0.2102 is now available"},{"content":"2021 is going to be a big year for Léo Corporation.

There was two suite at the time: \u0026ldquo;Essential\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gestion\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;Hub\u0026rdquo; is similar to an app launcher. The first attempt failed, and so did the second. It failed because mainly of this two reasons:\nBad UI/UX (User Interface/User eXperience) Not enough promotion This is why, during summer 2020, we recreated completely the Essential suite under a new name, the Tooly Suite. This third version was shiped along a brand new design and user experience. Unfortunately, this third attempt also failed, mainly because there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of updates, and also because the concept wasn\u0026rsquo;t being promoted. This third attempt will be our last one as Leo Corporation is going in a new direction.\nWhat does the end of support means? It means that there won\u0026rsquo;t be any updates anymore, and you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to download the Tooly Suite. It will be removed from our website and Xalyus Store later this month.\nDoes this mean that I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use Tooly Suite? No. You can still continue to use it, but some features may not work in the future, like the auto-update system.\nAre you going to Open Source Tooly Suite? There is no plans yet to do so.\nMoving forward We acknowledge the failure of this concept, and we hope that we will learn from the mistakes made so this won\u0026rsquo;t reproduce in the future again.

Today, there is a lot of game launcher that you need to use depending on the game you wanna play. This is often annoying and this is why we created Gavilya.\nIntegrations and Features Gavilya uses the RAWG.io video games database to get all your games informations automatically. Gavilya uses the RAWG API to get the background image of a game, the game\u0026rsquo;s description and even on wich platforms the game is available on. If you think that the game found by Gavilya in the RAWG database is wrong, you can change the associated game in the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; window.\nYou can also know which games you played recently, or even know how long you\u0026rsquo;ve played a specific game. Gavilya uses a system that can detect if you are playing a game and count the time you\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it. Sometimes this system doesn\u0026rsquo;t works with games that have a different process name than it\u0026rsquo;s executable file (like Minecraft). This is why you can manually set the process to look for (for Minecraft it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;javaw\u0026rdquo;).\nOpen Source Gavilya is also one of our open-source projects. You can contribute to the code, report issues and bugs with Gavilya and more.
