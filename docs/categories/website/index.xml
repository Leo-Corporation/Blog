This change will give us more control over our content and makes it easier to publish new and exciting articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-new">What is new?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The blog is now using a modern responsive theme that support both light and dark mode. We are introducing “Categories”; it is a new way to sort articles. There is now a table of content in every article, you can also see the estimated reading time next to the date. We have added links to our socials as well, and a brand new About page too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-gone">What is gone?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With this new update, we have decided it is the best time to move on, so our older articles from 2018 to 2020, are no longer available, but they still are on the old blog which will stay accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We hope that you will like the modern design; we are excited to post new and better articles on this blog, as a big announcement is coming soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A slight update on our look</title><link>https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/07/a-slight-update-on-our-look/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/07/a-slight-update-on-our-look/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2022/07/a-slight-update-on-our-look/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post A slight update on our look" />&lt;h2 id="we-have-a-new-look">We have a new look!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As you may have noticed, we’ve updated our font in our logos and websites. We are announcing that we’re ditching the Montserrat font for Hauora Sans. This font gives more personality to our identity, since the old font was one of the most popular sans serif fonts used in apps, websites, and product. The new one is – indeed – like Montserrat, but it adds some small details that makes it better than the old one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="when-will-this-change-take-effect">When will this change take effect?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As we said, most of our websites have already received an update. However, our apps haven’t yet. An update should roll out to them this month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Léo Corporation is always evolving, and we would like to thank our users for taking this journey with us.&lt;/p>

It might be hard for them to understand why is one our software, service, isn’t working, or why they can’t access our website anymore for instance. We often inform our users of any issues impacting our services on our Twitter account &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/LeoCorpNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@LeoCorpNews&lt;/a>, but some people aren’t aware of the existence of this account, or don’t use Twitter. This is why we’ve created a new website dedicated to “status monitoring”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new website is available at &lt;a class="link" href="https://status.leocorporation.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>status.leocorporation.dev&lt;/a> and is updated every day. You can quickly see which system is operating normally, and those who don’t. If you are having an issue with one of our services that depend on others, such as our update system, Gavilya’s integration with RAWG, you can come to this website and see if everything is working correctly or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this website helps you to get informed when an issue is occurring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New website</title><link>https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/05/new-website/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/05/new-website/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/05/new-website/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post New website" />&lt;p>Starting today, leocorp.fr will no longer be our main website, and will be replace by leocorporation.dev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few years using a Wix website, we have made the decision to stop using Wix services and build instead our own website ourselves. We wanted a more personal website that entirely belongs to us, and this is now the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a few weeks now, we have been working on a new website using GitHub Pages for the hosting. You could access the website by entering the “https://leo-corporation.github.io/Leo-Corporation-Web/” URL, but you can now access it by typing “leocorporation.dev” in your browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will notice that the forum is no longer present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this change, we also changed the blog URL, you can type “blog.leocorporation.dev” to access the blog quicker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new website is – of course – &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Leo-Corporation/Leo-Corporation-Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Open-Source&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we said earlier, this year is going to be a big one for Léo Corporation, so stay tuned for more exciting announcements in the next months, and thanks to everyone supporting Léo Corporation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A new look</title><link>https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/a-new-look/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/a-new-look/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.leocorporation.dev/2021/02/a-new-look/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post A new look" />&lt;p>2021 is going to be a big year for Léo Corporation. And one of the big announcement this year is our new graphic identity. You may notice, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got a new logo and a new &lt;a class="link" href="https://leocorporation.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is a part of our new direction for this year. The new logo is more coloful than the older one, and has a new font that we are starting to roll out to our customers: Montserrat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is not only this. We&amp;rsquo;ve also updated some icons of our softwares:&lt;/p>
