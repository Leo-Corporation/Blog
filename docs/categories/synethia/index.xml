>NuGet package&lt;/a> for your .NET projects. Synethia is a powerful C# algorithm that helps you understand and optimize the behavior of your users with your application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Synethia, you can detect how long your users are spending on each part of your app, as well as how many interactions they have with it. Based on these two factors, Synethia calculates a score for each page or part of your app, allowing you to customize the experience of your users and understand which features they use the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Synethia in your project is easy and intuitive, making it a valuable tool for any developer looking to improve the user experience of their application. Plus, with support for .NET 5 and higher, Synethia is a reliable choice for your Windows projects.&lt;/p>
