## Improved Password Preset Experience

Starting with this new version of Passliss, you can now edit your presets without having to delete them and recreate them each time you want to make a modification. We also improve the user interface of the preset page to make it clearer and simpler to quickly understand the different properties of each preset. Finally, we also added the possibility to import and export password presets, so you can bring them to different machines more easily.

## Other improvements
