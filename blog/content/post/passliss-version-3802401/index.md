This new version of Passliss introduces several improvements to the UI of the app and new improvements for mobile users.

## New strength details in Activity

It is now possible to get detailed information about the strength of a password directly in the Activity page, just click on the strength indicator to get more information. On mobile devices, we redesigned the "More" button: Instead of a context menu, a drawer UI will now show up with detailed information about the password. At the bottom of the drawer, you will find different actions, such as "Copy", "Close" and "Delete".
