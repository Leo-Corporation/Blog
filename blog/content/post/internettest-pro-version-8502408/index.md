The latest update to InternetTest Pro brings a sleek and user-friendly design to the Adapter Window.

The centerpiece of the Adapter Window is its Main Section, meticulously crafted to provide users with a quick overview of their network connection status. This section displays crucial information such as:

- **Total Data Consumption:** Easily monitor your internet usage to keep track of data limits or identify unusual spikes in activity. This feature is particularly beneficial for users with capped data plans.
- **Connection Status:** Instantly determine whether your device is connected to the internet, with visual cues indicating the current status. This feature helps users quickly troubleshoot connectivity issues.
- **Network Adapter Type:** Identify the type of network adapter you are using, whether it’s wired or wireless, allowing for tailored troubleshooting and configuration.

This streamlined presentation ensures that all essential data is accessible at a glance, saving users time and effort in managing their network connections.

Beyond the Main Section, InternetTest Pro’s new Adapter Window design offers two additional sections dedicated to advanced and detailed information. These sections are designed for users who require deeper insights into their network configurations and performance.

The inclusion of a Bluetooth icon for adapters provides quick visual identification of Bluetooth connections.
