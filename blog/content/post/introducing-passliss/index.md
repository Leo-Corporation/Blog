After a month of developpment, Passliss, the successor of Password Generator 3 is out and generaly available for the public.

## Introduction
Password Generator is part of our most popular softwares since the launch of the third version. This third version was designed to be built on a more modern platform (C# - Windows Forms) and also to deliver a more modern UI (Guna.UI) For Passliss, we chose to focus on one thing: innovation. Passliss is our second software to be built using WPF, and our first software to use our new design guidelines, which mainely focus on User eXperience (UX) but also on User Interface (UI). Thanks to this guidelines, Passliss is offering to our users an intuitive and modern experience.

Passliss can also evaluate the strenght of a password. There is multiples levels of strenght:
- Low, you should change your password
- Medium, adding more complexity to your password would be a nice addition
- Good, you can safely use this password
- Excellent, the chances of someone finding your password are near inexistant.
