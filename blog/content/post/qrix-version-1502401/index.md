With this new version of Qrix, we made several improvements to the app's design, fixing many UI inconsistencies. Furthermore, we also added a new preview dialog in History.

## Preview dialog

When clicking on a QR Code or on a Bar Code, you will notice a new preview window dialog appearing, allowing you to see more clearly your generate code, especially on mobile devices. This feature should make it easier to scan generated QR Codes directly on a mobile device.
