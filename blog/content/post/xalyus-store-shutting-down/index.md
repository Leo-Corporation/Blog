## Xalyus Store is shutting down

Hello everyone,

We have some important news to share with you today. After more than two years of providing you with a variety of software products, we have decided to **shut down Xalyus Store**.

This was not an easy decision to make, but we believe it is the best one for our company and our users. We want to **unify the methods to get our apps** and make them more accessible and convenient for you.

From now on, you can still download safely all of our apps on our [**official store website**](https://leocorporation.dev/store). There, you will find the latest versions of our products.

We want to thank you for your support and loyalty over the years. You have been an amazing community and we are grateful for your feedback and suggestions. We hope you will continue to enjoy our apps and follow us on our social media channels.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [contact us](https://leocorporation.dev/contact). We will be happy to assist you.

Thank you for choosing Léo Corporation!

_- The Léo Corporation Team_
