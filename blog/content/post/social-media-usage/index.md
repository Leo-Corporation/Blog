## How we use social media to connect with you

LÃ©o Corporation is a company that creates and maintains applications for Windows and the web. We are passionate about creating experiences that will make you more productive. We have a portfolio of apps that range from password generators to game launchers, from color pickers to database managers, and more. You can find all our projects on our website: https://leocorporation.dev.

But we are not only about creating apps. We are also about connecting with you, our users, and sharing our vision, updates, tips and tricks, and more. That's why we are present on various social media platforms, where we showcase our apps and engage with our community. Here are some of the ways we use social media to communicate with you:

### TikTok

TikTok is a popular platform for short-form videos, where users can express their creativity, humor, talent, and more. We use TikTok to create short tutorials and videos about our apps, showing how they work, what features they have, and how they can help you in your daily tasks. For example, you can watch a video on how to use Passliss, a web app that allows you to generate secure passwords and test the strength of existing ones. Or you can watch a video on how to use InternetTest, a modern connection utility for Windows that can locate IP addresses, send ping requests, recover your WiFi passwords, and more. You can follow us on TikTok here: https://www.tiktok.com/@leocorporation_.

### X (Twitter)

Twitter or X is a platform for sharing short messages, news, opinions, and more. We use Twitter to post updates about our apps, such as new releases, bug fixes, feature requests, and more. You can also interact with us on Twitter by asking questions, giving feedback, or just saying hi. We are always happy to hear from you and respond to your queries. You can follow us on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/LeoCorpNews.

### Instagram and Facebook

Instagram and Facebook are platforms for sharing photos, videos, stories, and more. We use Instagram and Facebook to post updates about our apps as well, but also to share behind-the-scenes glimpses of our development process, team members, events, and more. You can also see some of the screenshots and previews of the apps that we are working on or improving. You can follow us on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/leocorporation_/ and on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/LeoCorporationSoftwares.

As you can see, we are very active on social media and love to connect with you. If you are interested in our apps or want to learn more about them, you can follow us on any of these platforms or visit our website.
