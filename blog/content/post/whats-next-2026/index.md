## A New Chapter: The Sunsetting of GRP and the Future Within Léo Corporation

Over the past years, GRP has served as a home for multiple projects driven by curiosity, experimentation, and a desire to build useful software. Today, we are announcing an important change. Due to a lack of time and available resources, GRP as a parent organization will be sunset.

This decision reflects the reality of maintaining several projects while trying to uphold the level of quality and long-term sustainability they deserve. Rather than allowing projects to slowly lose momentum, we believe it is more responsible to make this transition openly and clearly.

As a result, all GRP projects will be transferred to Léo Corporation. Some of them will continue to be maintained and improved under this new structure, while others will be officially discontinued. Among the projects that will no longer be maintained are Synapsy As A Service (which are now free) and Devyus. These projects will not receive further updates or support going forward.

Centralizing development under Léo Corporation allows us to focus our efforts, reduce fragmentation, and ensure that the projects we continue to support can evolve in a stable and sustainable way. This shift also provides clearer direction for users and contributors, with a stronger emphasis on quality and long-term commitment.

We would like to sincerely thank everyone who has used, supported, or contributed to GRP projects over the years. Your interest and involvement made these initiatives possible. While this announcement marks the end of GRP as a parent organization, it also opens a new chapter focused on clarity, focus, and sustainability within Léo Corporation.

We already have retired the DevyusCode GitHub organization, moved the status page to status.leocorporation.dev, and are in the process of migrating other assets. GRP Accounts have also been removed and are no longer functional.

More information will be shared as the transition progresses and as the future of each project becomes clearer.

## Looking Ahead

Léo Corporation remains committed to delivering high-quality software and services. We are excited about the opportunities this transition presents and look forward to continuing to serve our users with renewed focus and dedication. This year, we released several updates to Passliss, Qrix, and InternetTest Pro, and we have more planned for 2026 and beyond.

Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this new journey together!
