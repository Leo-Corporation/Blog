A new version of InternetTest Pro is available and it brings several improvements to the design of the app, as well as a new export WiFi Profiles feature.

## Export WiFI Profiles

You can export saved WiFi profiles on your devices to a folder where all the different profiles will be available inside XML files. You can also choose whether to store the WiFi key as plain text or keep it encrypted if you want.

## New Adapter Info window

We redesigned the Adapter Info window to make it easier to access to some key information such as: The current adapter status, the adapter name, and the total amount of data received and sent. This new UI makes it easier for you to see if you exceeded your data consumption quotas for example.
