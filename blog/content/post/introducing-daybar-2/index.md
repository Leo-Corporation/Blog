## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, time is our most valuable asset. How we manage it can significantly impact our productivity and overall well-being. Enter DayBar 2 – the upgraded version of the beloved time-tracking tool that revolutionizes how you perceive and utilize your time.

With the release of DayBar 2, we've taken user feedback and innovative design principles to heart, resulting in a sleek and modern interface that seamlessly integrates with the aesthetics of other Léo Corporation Apps. But that's just the beginning.

## New features

### Modern design

DayBar 2 boasts a fresh, modern design that not only enhances the user experience but also aligns with the high standards set by other Léo Corporation applications. Say goodbye to cluttered interfaces – DayBar 2's intuitive layout ensures that keeping track of your time feels like second nature.

### ToDo List feature

The crown jewel of DayBar 2 is its brand new todo list feature. We understand that time management goes hand in hand with task management, which is why we've integrated a robust todo list right into DayBar. Now, users can create tasks, mark them as completed, set due dates, and even remove them with just a few clicks.

### New settings page

We also took time to rethink the way you can set your settings by adding a new settings page, where you can quickly find all the settings you need to craft your perfect experience.

## How to upgrade

DayBar 2 is available as a direct and automatic update for DayBar 1 users. You only have to check for updates in the app settings to receive DayBar 2.
