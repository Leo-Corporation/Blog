## New Harmonies section

We also added a new Harmonies section in the Palette page, enhancing the user experience even when no colors have been bookmarked yet. These new placeholders are not only visually appealing but also serve as subtle guides, encouraging users to explore the app's bookmarking feature. You will also notice that we removed the Harmonies page from the app to merge all of its features into the Palette page. This change will make it easier for users to access all the color harmonies and palettes in one place.

## New Update section

In the latest update of ColorPicker, users will notice a significant enhancement in the Update section, designed to streamline experience. The new design introduces a more intuitive and visually appealing interface, making it easier than ever to access and understand detailed color information.

## Other improvements
