Starting today, leocorp.fr will no longer be our main website, and will be replace by leocorporation.dev.

After a few years using a Wix website, we have made the decision to stop using Wix services and build instead our own website ourselves. We wanted a more personal website that entirely belongs to us, and this is now the case.

For a few weeks now, we have been working on a new website using GitHub Pages for the hosting. You could access the website by entering the “https://leo-corporation.github.io/Leo-Corporation-Web/” URL, but you can now access it by typing “leocorporation.dev” in your browser.

You will notice that the forum is no longer present.

With this change, we also changed the blog URL, you can type “blog.leocorporation.dev” to access the blog quicker.


The new website is – of course – [Open-Source](https://github.com/Leo-Corporation/Leo-Corporation-Web).

As we said earlier, this year is going to be a big one for Léo Corporation, so stay tuned for more exciting announcements in the next months, and thanks to everyone supporting Léo Corporation.
