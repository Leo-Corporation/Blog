Dear Léo Corporation Community,

I want to share an important update with all of you. As some of you may know, I recently began my university studies, which has been an exciting new chapter in my life. However, this means I now have less time to dedicate to Léo Corporation and its projects.

### What Does This Mean?

While Léo Corporation isn’t going anywhere, you’ll notice fewer updates and new releases in the coming years. I will still work on bug fixes and important updates when I can, but my focus will be primarily on my studies. The pace of development will slow, but the quality of our products will remain the same.

### Thank You for Your Support

I want to sincerely thank all of you for your continued support and enthusiasm. Your feedback and passion have been the driving force behind Léo Corporation’s growth, and I look forward to returning with fresh ideas and updates in the future.

In the meantime, stay connected through our usual channels, and I’ll continue to provide updates as often as I’m able.

Thank you for your understanding!  
**Léo Peyronnet**  
Founder, Léo Corporation
