A new version of Qrix is now available, and it is the version 1.9.0.2407. We added the possibility to search history, to see directly the metadata of Interactive QR Codes and more.

## New features in History page

Qrix has elevated user experience with its latest update, introducing powerful new features for managing and viewing Interactive QR Codes. Users can now effortlessly search their Bar/QR Code history, streamlining the process of revisiting and managing past creations. This feature is particularly valuable for businesses and event organizers who need quick access to previously generated codes. Additionally, Qrix now offers direct visibility into the metadata of Interactive QR Codes, providing insights into embedded information such as URL destinations, contact details, or event specifics without the need for scanning.

## New navigation bar

We added a new navigation bar on desktop devices, making the app design clearer. This new navbar is similar to [Passliss' new navbar](/blog/content/post/passliss-version-4302407/) we introduced yesterday.
