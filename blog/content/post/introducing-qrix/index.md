## What’s next for Gerayis?

After careful consideration and in line with our commitment to providing the best user experience possible, we have made the decision to discontinue support for Gerayis for Windows. Gerayis will still work but we won’t bring any new updates to it. For new features, users can migrate to Qrix. To get started with it, simply access it through your preferred web browser. The best part is that Qrix can also be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your Windows device. This means you can have the convenience of a dedicated app-like experience while still benefiting from the versatility of a web-based solution.
By transitioning to Qrix, you will gain access to all the features and functionality you enjoyed with Gerayis, and more.

We understand that change can sometimes be challenging, but we are confident that Qrix will exceed your expectations and become your go-to solution for code generation. Our team is dedicated to providing continuous support and updates for Qrix, ensuring that you have the best possible experience while using our app.

As we move forward, we encourage all Windows users to transition from Gerayis to Qrix. We appreciate your understanding and are excited to embark on this new chapter with you. Should you have any questions or need assistance during the transition, our support team is available to help.
