2021 has been a busy year for Léo Corporation, and 2022 will be focused on how we can improve the user experience across our products.

To start this new year, we’ve slightly updated our visual identity to a more colorful one. You may have seen on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeoCorpNews), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LeoCorporationSoftwares/), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/leocorporation_/) that a more colorful look has been adapted. These colors are – of course – colors of Léo Corporation, but they are also here to bring a more vibrant vibe to our posts. However, we haven’t changed our logo, even though there are now a black and a white variant of it. You will also notice new splash screens that will come to applications that use one on the upcoming weeks.
