A new version of Gavilya is now available, and it is version 4.6.0.2503. We added several new features, such as the possibility to change the default monitor, a new theme section, and more.

## New Theme section

One of the standout features in this update is the addition of a new Theme section. This new section provides a comprehensive view of your available themes, allowing you to quickly assess their status and details.

Please note that you will need to update the themes to the latest version to use them with this new version of Gavilya. If you don't, you may experience issues with the app, especially with the new About section.

## Monitor Changer
