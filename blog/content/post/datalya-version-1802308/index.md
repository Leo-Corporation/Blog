A new version of Datalya is now available, and it brings the new Number Input Block.

## Number Block

The new Number Input Block is similar to the Text Input Block, except it only allows relative integer numbers to be entered. The Block also has the ability to only accept numbers from a specific range, and you can customize the appearance of the Block: You can choose between a regular text field or a drop-down menu (if you selected a custom range).
