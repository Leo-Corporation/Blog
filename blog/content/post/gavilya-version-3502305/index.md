Themes allow you to customize the appearance of Gavilya according to your preferences and style. You can import custom themes from other users or create your own!

To access the Themes feature, simply go to the Settings menu and click on Themes. There you will find a list of available themes that you can preview and apply. In the future, we also plan to release a theme store and editor on our website.

Themes are a great way to personalize your Gavilya experience and make it more fun and immersive. Whether you want to match your game launcher with your games, your personality, or your mood, Themes have got you covered. Try them out today and let us know what you think!
