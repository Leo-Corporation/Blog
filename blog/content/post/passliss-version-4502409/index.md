One of the standout features of Passliss 4.5.0.2409 is the revamped settings page. The new design is intuitive, offering a clean, modern interface that makes configuring the application easier than ever. Letâ€™s explore the new settings options and how they can improve your experience with Passliss.

### New layout

The settings page now has Tab layout, making it easier to switch between settings. You no longer need to expand a section to get all available settings, making it quicker to make changes in your configuration. This new user interface is also more intuitive for new users, improving the overall user experience. Now new settings were introduced; it is a UI update.

### New About Section: Transparency and Control
