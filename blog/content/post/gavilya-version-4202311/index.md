A new version of Gavilya is available and it brings several new features, such as the new Win32 game scanner and more.

## Game Scanner

![The new game scanner popup](1.png)

When adding a Win32 game to Gavilya, you can now scan a particular directory to find all available executables inside of it and inside of its subdirectories. This can be particularly useful if you have a hard drive dedicated to games and don't know where are the games executables located.

## Random game

If you have a lot of games available in your library, it can sometimes be hard to make a choice. This why we also added back an old feature of Gavilya: Random game selection. In the home page, you will notice a new lightbulb icon next to the "You may like..." section. Clicking this icon will take you to a random game page. This feature can be useful if you really don't know which game you want to play.

## More customization options

Finally, we added new customization options and settings. You can now disable the search shortcut (Control+K) in the settings. Plus, it is now possible the pin the main window so it always stays on top of others.
