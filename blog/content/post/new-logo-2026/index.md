Today, Léo Corporation unveils a new logo that reflects the end of GRP and the natural evolution that follows: the full centralization of projects, ideas, and ambitions under a single identity, Léo Corporation. Over time, our ecosystem has grown, shifted, and matured. Bringing everything together under one banner allows us to move forward with greater clarity, consistency, and focus.

While the visual identity evolves, the spirit remains the same. This new logo is not just a design update — it’s a symbol of consolidation, long-term vision, and a fresh chapter for Léo Corporation.
