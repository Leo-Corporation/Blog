Passliss 5 marks a significant evolution in password management. Built from the ground up with security and user experience in mind, this new version brings together cutting-edge technology and thoughtful design to help you generate, test, and manage strong passwords more efficiently than ever before.

## Smarter Passwords with AI

One of the standout features in Passliss 5 is the new AI-powered password generation system. You can now create strong and unique passwords simply by typing a prompt. Thanks to the integration of OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini, Passliss can understand your intent and generate passwords that are both secure and context-aware, offering a more intuitive approach to digital protection.

## Improved Strength Analysis

The strength analysis tool has been completely redesigned. With a clearer interface and deeper insights, the new Strength page helps you understand not just how strong your password is, but why. Detailed suggestions and real-time feedback guide you toward creating more secure credentials for all your accounts.

## More Control on the Generate Page

The Generate page in Passliss 5 has been expanded with more control and flexibility. You can now toggle between a simplified interface for quick generation and an advanced section for fine-tuning every aspect of your password. There's also support for generating multiple passwords at once and exporting them as CSV, making it ideal for managing several accounts.

## Robust Encryption and Hashing

Security goes beyond passwords. With the enhanced Encryption page, you can now encrypt and decrypt any string using trusted algorithms like AES and Triple-DES. Passliss 5 also introduces a new hashing section, allowing you to hash sensitive data directly within the app.

## Full Customization and Personalization

Passliss 5 gives you full control over your environment. From changing the language and theme to setting default values for password length and encryption algorithms, everything is customizable. You can also export and import your preferences, or reset everything to default in a few clicks.

## A Streamlined and Modern Experience

Passliss 5 isn’t just an update — it’s a complete rethinking of what password tools can be.
